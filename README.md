Emotion Detection Project
Overview
This project focuses on detecting emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images into different emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

Features
Image Processing: Preprocessing of facial images to enhance model performance.
CNN Model: A deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras.
Real-time Detection: Integration with a webcam to detect emotions in real-time.
